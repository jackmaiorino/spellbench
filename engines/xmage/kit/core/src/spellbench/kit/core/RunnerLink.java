/**
 * The front's link to its runner process (design Section 2.1). One request at a time; every request carries a
 * sequence number, and a reply whose number is not the pending one is discarded (late results never answer a later
 * request). The runner's stderr goes to a log file, never to the front's stdout.
 * <p>
 * Every request of a {@code choose} shares that request's clock (A1 result review, change 2): the caller passes the
 * absolute time by which it must have the reply ({@code waitUntil}) and the time by which its answer leaves
 * ({@code answerBy}). Waiting for a replacement runner that is still booting, the runner's own safety deadline (the
 * reply time minus the grace period) and the kill all fit inside that window. A request with no reply by
 * {@code waitUntil} ends the runner: it is destroyed forcibly and its exit confirmed until {@code answerBy}; when the
 * exit cannot be confirmed in time, a reaper thread confirms it in the background, and the next start waits for the
 * reaper (a killed H2 process can leave a lock file, removed only after the confirmed exit). Until the exit is
 * confirmed the link is latched (second result review, item 1): no replacement starts and every request is refused
 * with {@code Busy("runner_exit_unconfirmed")}, so the caller answers by fallback; the latch clears only when the
 * killed process is seen gone (then its locks are removed and a replacement may start). A request that cannot get
 * a runner in time (a replacement still booting, too little time left) is refused with {@link Busy}: nothing is sent
 * and nothing is killed.
